# TTS-MtG-CardImporter
This was cloned from the following mod for Tabletop Simulator:

I'd like to try to play around and make some updates to this. It seems like a good way to get familiar with Lua and scripting for TTS


## Planned steps

* Improve Readability of the code. As somebody with a C# background I have a lot of trouble parsing the scripts. While reading through Lua tutorials I will get a grasp of formatting styles, and choose my own standard.
* Improve referencing images for cardbacks. I've had issues with referencing certain images with special characters in the URL (eg: `-`)
* Figure out some other things to do.
